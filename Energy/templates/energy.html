                                Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of particles within a substance, resulting from 
                                their movement. It increases with temperature and is transferred through conduction, 
                                convection, or radiation. Thermal energy is essential for heating homes, cooking food, and 
                                industrial processes like metal smelting. It is generated by burning fuels, geothermal 
                                sources, or friction. Steam turbines in power plants convert thermal energy into electricity, 
                                highlighting its role in modern energy production. Managing thermal energy efficiently is 
                                crucial for energy conservation and environmental sustainability, as excessive heat production 
                                can lead to waste and increased carbon emissions.

        <h1>Power of Renewables</h1>
        <p>Renewable energy is derived from wind, solar, hydro, and other natural sources. 
            Unlike fossil fuels, which deplete over time and harm the environment, 
            renewables offer a clean, inexhaustible energy supply that reduces carbon 
            emissions and combats climate change. Businesses and governments investing in renewable technologies benefit 
            from lower long-term energy costs, energy independence, and job creation in green industries. 
            Advances in battery storage and smart grid technology are making renewables more reliable 
            than ever, addressing the challenge of intermittent supply. As global demand for energy rises, transitioning 
            to renewables ensures a sustainable, resilient future—one where energy is abundant, 
            affordable, and aligned with planetary health. The power of renewables isn't just 
            in the energy they produce, but in the brighter, cleaner future they make possible.
